Finally, my first blog post. So why am I setting up a Jekyll blog? 

I am preparing a personal site to keep track of my portfolio, resume, and technical blogging. I am not a writer, so don't expect me to write too much. What I have in mind currently is to keep track of my LeetCode progress. In particular, questions and answers of each LeetCode questions I'll be working on. I also have a website that I worked on right now that I'd like to add to my portfolio as well as some of the technical backgrounds of how things work.
