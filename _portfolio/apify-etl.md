Apify-etl is a collection of git repositories to provide [ETL](https://github.com/wchen02/apify-etl-lib) (extract, transform, and load) functionalities. 
- It uses apify web scraper to extract data from websites. 
- [Normalizer](https://github.com/wchen02/normalizer) repo to transform the data.
- [Loader](https://github.com/wchen02/loader) to insert the transformed data into the a relational database.

I have also included a [CLI](https://github.com/wchen02/apify-etl-cli) utility and a [server](https://github.com/wchen02/apify-etl-server) to process webhook events from apify server.
